# FederalistPaperAuthorship

The Federalist Papers were a set of 85 essays published between 1787 and 1788 to promote the ratification of the United States Constitution. They were originally published under the pseudonym "Publius". Although the identity of the authors was a closely guarded secret at the time, most of the papers have since been conclusively attributed to one of Hamilton, Jay, or Madison. The known authorships can be found in `https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/federalist/authorship.csv`.

For 15 of the papers, however, the authorships remain disputed. (These papers can be identified from the `authorship.csv` file because the "Author" field is blank.) In this analysis, I will use the papers with known authorship to predict the authorships of the disputed papers. The text of each paper is available at `https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/federalist/x.txt`, where `x` is the number of the paper (i.e., a number from 1 to 85). The name of the file indicates the number of the paper.
